# Codex Configuration

Production-ready configuration for Codex: global instructions, lessons-based self-improvement, layered coding standards through skills, MCP integration, and one-command bootstrap.

## Directory Structure

```
.
├── AGENTS.md              # Global instructions
├── config.toml            # Codex settings (model, permissions, MCP, lesson injection)
├── lessons.md             # Self-correction log template
└── install.sh             # One-command installer
```

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone -b codex https://github.com/Mizoreww/claude-code-config.git
cd claude-code-config
bash install.sh
```

Then restart Codex.

## Key Features

### Self-Improvement Loop

1. User correction is recorded into `~/.codex/lessons.md`
2. New sessions load lessons automatically
3. Stable patterns are promoted into `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`

### Lesson Auto-Load (Codex-Native)

`config.toml` uses:

```toml
model_instructions_file = "~/.codex/lessons.md"
```

This keeps correction memory active without additional startup hooks.

### Layered Rules via Skills

```
core behavior   → AGENTS.md
  ↓ reinforced by
skills/rules    → claude-rules, python-patterns, golang-patterns, frontend-patterns
```

This keeps common principles and language-specific practices aligned.

### Skill-First Setup

`install.sh` bootstraps practical skills from open-source ecosystems:

| Skill Set | Source | Coverage |
|----------|--------|----------|
| superpowers | [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) | planning, debugging, TDD workflows |
| everything-claude-code | [affaan-m/everything-claude-code](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code) | language patterns, testing, security, verification |
| anthropic skills packs | [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) | document tools, frontend design, canvas/art, MCP builder |
| claude-mem | [thedotmack/claude-mem](https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem) | persistent memory workflows (`make-plan`, `do`, `mem-search`) |
| AI research skills | [zechenzhangAGI/AI-research-SKILLs](https://github.com/zechenzhangAGI/AI-research-SKILLs) | fine-tuning, post-training, inference, distributed training, optimization |

### MCP Integration

Default MCP servers in `config.toml`:

| Server | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Lark MCP | Feishu/Lark docs, sheets, chats, base ([repo](https://github.com/larksuite/lark-openapi-mcp)) |
| Context7 | up-to-date library documentation lookup ([repo](https://github.com/upstash/context7)) |
| GitHub | issue/PR/repo workflows ([repo](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server)) |
| Playwright | browser automation and E2E testing ([repo](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp)) |

## Installation Notes

1. Fill your own credentials:
   - `YOUR_APP_ID` / `YOUR_APP_SECRET` (Lark)
   - `YOUR_GITHUB_PAT` (GitHub MCP)
2. This config uses current Codex style (for example `web_search = "live"` at top-level).
3. If `~/.codex/config.toml` already exists, merge manually.

## Security Note

Template defaults are power-user oriented:
- `approval_policy = "never"`
- `sandbox_mode = "danger-full-access"`

If you prefer safer defaults, adjust these in `~/.codex/config.toml`.

## Customization

- **Adjust global behavior**: edit `AGENTS.md`
- **Add local rules**: extend skills in `~/.codex/skills`
- **Tune model/runtime**: edit `config.toml`
- **Enable/disable MCP servers**: edit MCP sections in `config.toml` or use `codex mcp` commands
